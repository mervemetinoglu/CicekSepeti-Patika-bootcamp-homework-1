## CicekSepeti-Patika.dev React Bootcamp Homework 1

This project created by using **ReactJS** for homework from **CicekSepeti-Patika.dev React Bootcamp**.\
There are three pages; Home, Form and Cards.\
Home page allows to you go to the other pages by side navigation bar.\
Form page has a form, obviously :) You can fill the form and when submit the form you'll see a modal.\
Cards page fetch mock data and display them as a card. Also you can search cards by their title or body infos.\
Demo available is here, you can check it: [Demo:star2:](https://ciceksepeti-patika-react-bootcamp-hw1.netlify.app/)
